# Jazzmyn's Apothecary

Jazzmyn's Apothecary is a personal web app designed to support an amateur herbalist build an on-demand inventory/apothecary. It functions as a dynamic note-taking tool, inventory list, forumla guide, and cheatsheet, allowing users to document herbs through different identifying qualities, search and filter entries, and share curated knowledge with others via copyable links. Built with simplicity and purpose, this app empowers learners to organize and access information about utilizing herbal medicine anytime, anywhere.

## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Appwrite
This project was developed using Next.js with the App Router for modern routing and component structure. Tailwind CSS powers the design system, enabling rapid styling and responsive layouts. Appwrite handles authentication and database interactions, ensuring secure access and scalable data management.
Users can:

- Add and edit herbal entries
- Search and filter herbs by name or category
- Copy links to share specific entries with others

The app uses both client and server components to manage state and restrict access to authenticated users. Clipboard functionality allows seamless sharing, and the interface is optimized for clarity and ease of use.

## Optimize

Future enhancements include:

- Image upload support for visual herb identification
- Social sharing features to spread herbal knowledge
- Improved categorization and tagging for faster filtering
- Formulary guide for quick reference materials
- Utilize Appwrite Function feature to keep track of login users, events, TBD.

## Lessons Learned

This project deepened my understanding of:

- Integrating client and server components in Next.js
- Managing user access and authentication securely
- Implementing clipboard interactions for shareable content

Jazzmyn Apothecary reflects the power of thoughtful tooling and user-centered design. Itâ€™s a foundation for more advanced, collaborative learning platforms to come.
